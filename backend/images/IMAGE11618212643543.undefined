subjects I learned were current, if not more so, in the company I 
joined. I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.</h3>

 many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a 
transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience 
here. I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun!
 I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and 
most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I’ve 
successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR 
startup. ” </p>

                <h3> Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended! </h3>
                        <span class="presentation"><p> Before joining 
the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed some structure
 from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I 
was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say 
wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did 
not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for
 assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It 
took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever 
have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example
 of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a 
full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! ”</p>

experiences was easy.</h3>

genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. 
The program gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the

incredible community of smart and amazing people. </p>
